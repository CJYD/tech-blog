# Hey there, I’m Christian

If you’d met me a few years ago, software wouldn’t have come up. I was busy figuring out what to study next when a late night Google spiral landed me on computer science course catalogs. The mix of logic, creativity, and straight-up problem-solving clicked. I’ve loved tech for as long as I can remember, from taking apart old phones to learning how to code task manager apps, so CS felt like the right kind of hard.

## How I got here

I started small: an intro Python class, a few YouTube tutorials, and the shock of seeing **Hello, World!** pop up because of something _I_ typed. One project led to another, then a bachelor’s program, and suddenly the terminal was my second home.

Along the way I noticed two things:

1. Most online guides skip the messy middle, the part where your code breaks at 2 a.m.  
2. Explaining a concept out loud is the best way to realize you only half understood it.

That’s where this blog comes in.

## What keeps me moving

Coding sessions get broken up by miles on the road. Running clears the mental cache; family time fills it back up with better stuff. I’m also hooked on learning new frameworks, cloud tricks, random rabbit holes about how HTTPS actually works.

## Why start a tech blog?

*Project deep dives* I’ll unpack the build choices behind my favorite side projects, the good and the ugly.  
*Quick tips* Short reads on shell shortcuts, regex magic, or that VS Code extension you didn’t know you needed.  
*Running + code* Sometimes I’ll blend passions, like crunching run data with Python or prototyping a pace predictor API.

## What’s next

Expect a post every other week. Some will be detailed walkthroughs; others might be half-formed thoughts on whatever tool I’m testing. If something lands or totally misses, let me know. I’m here to share wins, failures, and everything between.
