# Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### 1. Fixed Package Dependencies (CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION)
**Problem**: Build packages were in `devDependencies` which aren't installed in production builds
**Solution**: Moved the following packages to `dependencies`:
- `@tailwindcss/postcss` (v4.1.11)
- `autoprefixer` (v10.4.21) 
- `tailwindcss` (v4)

These packages are REQUIRED for the build process and must be in `dependencies` for production deployments.

### 2. Fixed Folder Naming Convention
**Problem**: `components/Layout` folder used uppercase which fails on case-sensitive Linux servers
**Solution**: 
- Renamed folder to `components/layout` (lowercase)
- Updated all imports from `@/components/Layout/` to `@/components/layout/`
- Affected files: app/page.tsx, app/about/page.tsx, app/blog/page.tsx, app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx, app/error.tsx, app/not-found.tsx

### 3. PostCSS Configuration
**Config**: Using `@tailwindcss/postcss` in postcss.config.mjs (correct for Tailwind CSS v4)
```javascript
plugins: {
  '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  autoprefixer: {},
}
```

### 4. Netlify Configuration
- **Build command**: `npm ci && npm run build` (clean install)
- **Node version**: 20 (updated from 18 for better Next.js 15 compatibility)
- **Publish directory**: `.next`

### 5. Build Verification
✅ Local build successful with no errors
✅ All TypeScript types valid
✅ ESLint warnings fixed
✅ Production build tested with `npm ci && npm run build`
